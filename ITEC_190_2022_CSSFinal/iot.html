                                <p>Although it may be smaller than your cell phone, the Raspberry Pi is a powerful
                                    minicomputer that is loved by many. It features two programming languages (Python
                                    and Scratch) and is easily connected to many other types of circuits and devices.
                                    Weighing in between 40-50 grams, this circuit board has incredibly dexterity when
                                    it comes to:
                                <ul id="examples">
                                    <li>Playing games</li>
                                    <li>Word processing</li>
                                    <li>Editing photos</li>
                                    <li>Browsing the internet</li>
                                </ul>
                                This gives it the ability to be easily transported and implemented into automating many
                                processes. For example, by attaching PH, humidity, water temperature, and light
                                intensity sensors, it would be very easy to produce your own vegetables – just get a
                                notification on your phone when you need to add water or fertilizer! Even better yet,
                                skip that part: add additional electronic pumps and a fertilizer dispenser – just pick
                                out the plants once the hard work is done. If that is still too much, add some more
                                gadgets!</p>

                                <p>IoT aren’t limited to being used on their own. When used together, you can make
                                    entire systems of smart devices that can be used to automate all sorts of things!
                                    One great example of this is hydroponics. Hydroponics is a production method where
                                    the plants are grown in a nutrient solution rather than in soil. While it reduces
                                    the level of manual labor required to grow crops, it does add a lot more complexity.
                                    Here is where IoT devices come in. With them you can automate most of the complexity
                                    using things like…
                                <ul id="examples">
                                    <li>Ultrasonic sensors to determine water level</li>
                                    <li>PH sensor</li>
                                    <li>Room temperature and humidity sensor</li>
                                    <li>Water temperature sensor</li>
                                    <li>Soil moisture sensor</li>
                                    <li>Light intensity sensor</li>
                                    <li>Rain sensor</li>
                                </ul>
                                With just these IoT devices, you know have a live data feed of detailed information
                                about your garden. You will always know exactly when you need to add water or
                                fertilizer, you can be alerted immediately if anything is going wrong (such as a leak,
                                or freezing temperatures), you can track how much sun they are getting, and even take
                                all this data and use it to optimize your garden!</p>

                                    If you are handy with a soldering iron and a multimeter, you can even take on the
                                    challenge of taking an existing “dumb” object and turning it into an IoT device. For
                                    example, a coffee maker!<br><br>
                                    By taking a regular water pump, wiring a relay to it, and then connecting that to a
                                    Raspberry Pi, this gave the Pi the ability to turn the pump on and off. An instant IoT
                                    device! Simply add a sensor to it as well to detect the coffee makers water
                                    level, so that when it gets low, it automagically turns the now "smart" pump on to refills
                                    itself. You may also include other sensors and software that could alert you to when the
                                    water bottle itself needed to be refilled.<br><br>
                                    As you can imagine, with enough creativity and technical skills, you can turn anything
                                    into an IoT device, the potential is limitless!
