            <ol class="panel1">
                <li>I think for most people, this device is still to early in development for it to impact the average
                    persons life. However, for those who like to be on the bleeding edge of tech, I can see how they may
                    use it.
                    The first thing that comes to mind is an AR desktop for your computer. You could move and resize
                    your monitors anywhere you would like in your home. Also, imagine a HUD that sits on top of your
                    view. You could have it interact with all of your smart device to get notifications, video feeds,
                    and more. Every diagram, video, or information you would like to see would be available in a more
                    interactive form than ever before.</li>
            </ol>
            </ar>

        <article id="details">
            <h1 class="accordion1">Education</h1>
            <ol class="panel1">
                <li>I think this technology could be very valuable to students pursuing a higher education. Engineering
                    students can take apart and build virtual objects right in front of them. Medical students could use
                    it to better study anatomy and practice procedures. Essentially, anywhere that a hands on approach
                    helps teach that usually isn't easily accessible could prove to be invaluable to students and
                    professors. Although the price is not at the correct figure for everyone, AR has potential to
                    increase home-learning experiences (although, for now, most other options are more cost effective
                    and just as efficient.)</li>
            </ol>

        <article id="details">
            <h1 class="accordion1">Medical</h1>
            <ol class="panel1">
                <li>I think that this could really help with surgeries and patient treatment in general. During a
                    surgery, the surgeon could have all of the patients vitals overlaid onto their vision, meaning they
                    wouldn't need to look away or ask for them. They could also use them to view x-rays and other types
                    of scans in a 3D environment. Modelling would also be far easier, since comparisons would be simple
                    to pull up = and second opinions are simple enough to access if a model can just be sent back and
                    fourth through colleagues. It may even be easier to access patients in difficult-to-travel areas,
                    since their information could be studied from anywhere (given that there is a suitable internet
                    connection.)

            <h2 class="accordion2">Video Games</h2>
            <ol class="panel2">
                <li>Games like pokemon Go already use AR to put pokemon into the world. But instead of needing to look
                    through your phone, you could see them everywhere you look! The immersion of such games have a
                    potential far beyond what is capable now (though, this territory is challenged through full virtual
                    reality headsets.) If AR sets became more main streams, they have the potential to increase social
                    game-play since it may be able to take on a more personal touch as the worlds may very well be able
                    to someday model around the shape of our homes/walls.</li>

            <h2 class="accordion2">The Web</h2>
            <ol class="panel2">
                <li>Websites could make pages that are specifically AR interactable, especially E-Commerce sites.
                    Instead of just looking at pictures of products, you could see it or possibly wear it in AR. You
                    could try on clothes before buying them, see what size something actually is, or simply view a demo
                    of a phone in AR that you can "hold" and interact with. With this, shopping could be more
                    comfortable as it is now - since you can sit on your couch while simply using your living room space
                    to display all your options.</li>
